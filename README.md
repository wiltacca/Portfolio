# Artifical Intelligence
![alt text](AIMLDL.png)

### Science that empowers computers to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing, and visual perception. Ai is a broader ﬁeld that contains several subﬁeld such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.

# Machine Learning

### Machine Learning is a subﬁeld of Artiﬁcial Intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience. It is important to note that all machine learning techniques are classiﬁed as Artiﬁcial Intelligence ones. However, not all Artiﬁcial Intelligence could count as Machine Learning since some basic Rule-based engines could be classiﬁed as AI but they do not learn from experience therefore they do not belong to the machine learning category.

### Supervised Machine Learning: In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well “labeled.” It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

**CLASSIFICATION -** This project performs HR analytics that is revolutionizing the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Here is an opportunity to try machine learning in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, feature engine, xgboost, math, joblib, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** HR dataset contains employee personal information, education background, past performance and more. 
* **Output:** Identified the employees most likely to get promoted.

**REGRESSION -** Airbnb wants to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Utilize all these features from the dataset to make predictions on the rental price of the listed properties.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, feature engine, xgboost, math, joblib, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Listing dataset contains the hosts information, the condition of listed properties, the reviews and more. 
* **Output:** Predicted rental price of the listed properties.

![alt text](python_coding01.jpg)

### Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

**CLUSTERING -** This project focuses on bank credir risk in particular the customer credit which is the bank will gain from giving credit only if the customers will not default on the loan, which means that they will not repay the debt. One of the solutions to address the bank problem is to use hierarchical clustering, which requires creating clusters that have predetermined order from bottom to top using the Agglomerative which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm uses to cluster unlabeled data points.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, wordcloud, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Loaddefault dataset contains customers’ history, such as age, debt ratio, monthly income, number of open credit lines and loans and more.
* **Output:** Discovered a cluster of customers with high credit risk.

**ASSOCIATION RULES -** This project create recommendation systems that are being widely used in all forms of digital platforms; Association rules can be applied in the form of TV Shows recommendation systems to discover the existing relations between features in the database.  By analysing the database, which contains TV shows of distinguishable users, it can find some interesting rules occurring in analysed data.

* **Python libraries used:**  pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, mlxtend, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** TV Shows dataset contains 9690 record of TV show watched by different customers.
* **Output:** Recommended the next TV show that a customer will be interested in watching.

# Deep Learning
![alt text](Neural_Network_Brain_Mimic.jpeg)

### Deep Learning is a specialized ﬁeld of Machine Learning that relies on training of Deep Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) using a large dataset such as images or texts. ANNs are information processing models inspired by the human brain. The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate to each other using electrical and chemical signals and enable humans to see, feel, and make decision. ANNs works by mathematically mimicking the human brain and connecting multiple “artiﬁcial” neurons in a multilayered fashion. The more hidden layers added to the network, the deeper the network gets. What differentiates deep learning from machine learning techniques is in their ability to extract features automatically as illustrated in the following example:


### * Machine learning Process: (1) selecting the model to train, (2) manually performing feature extraction.


### * Deep Learning Process: (1) Select the architecture of the network, (2) features are automatically extracted by feeding in the training data (such as images) along with the target class (label).

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks most commonly used for analysing visual imagery. Convolution layers are the building blocks of CNNs. Convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in input, such as an image. What makes CNN so powerful and useful is that it can generate excellent predictions with minimal image preprocessing. Also, the CNN is immune to spatial variance and can detect features anywhere in the input images.

**IMAGE CLASSIFICATIONS -** This project focuses on to build various multiclass image classification models to recognise and classify ten different types of food.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras, os, time, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Images of baby back ribs, bibimbap, cupcakes, dumplings, fried calamari, garlic bread, lasagna, pancakes, prime rib, and tiramisu.
* **Output:** Accurately classified the ten different types of food correctly.

### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) processes sequences by iterating through the sequence elements and maintaining a state containing information relative to what it has seen so far. In effect, an RNN is a type of neural network that has an internal loop. The state of the RNN is reset between processing two different, independent sequences so still consider one sequence a single data point: a single input to the network. What changes is that this data point is no longer processed in a single step; rather, the network internally loops over sequence elements.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was created as the solution to short-term memory caused by RNN. It has internal mechanisms called gates that can regulate the flow of information. An LSTM has a similar control flow as a recurrent neural network. It processes data passing on information as it propagates forward. The differences are the operations within the LSTM’s cells.

**SENTIMENT ANALYSIS -** This project focuses on to build a sentiment analysis model to predict Disney Plus Disney Plus App review scores based on Google Play Store reviews.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras, os, time, string, emoji, nltk, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Scraped the most recent reviews from com.disney.disneyplus (in Google Play Store) in English language from United State.
* **Output:** Accurately predict user input review scores correctly.

### The process of finding trends and correlations in our data by representing it pictorially is called Data Visualization. To perform data visualization in python, we can use various python data visualization modules such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc. In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.

**DATA VISUALIZATION -** This project focuses on by assuming that you are part of the market research team for Cardio Good Fitness, a retail business specializing in the sales of treadmills. The team has collected data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at the Cardio Good Fitness retail stores for the past three months.
Through data preparation, exploration and visualisation, the market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh.
