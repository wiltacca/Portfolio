### Supervised Machine Learning: In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well “labeled.” It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

**CLASSIFICATION -** This project performs HR analytics that is revolutionizing the way human resources departments operate, leading to higher efficiency and better results overall. Human resources have been using analytics for years. However, the collection, processing and analysis of data has been largely manual, and given the nature of human resources dynamics and HR KPIs, the approach has been constraining HR. Here is an opportunity to try machine learning in identifying the employees most likely to get promoted.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, feature engine, xgboost, math, joblib, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** HR dataset contains employee personal information, education background, past performance and more. 
* **Output:** Identified the employees most likely to get promoted.

**REGRESSION -** Airbnb wants to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Utilize all these features from the dataset to make predictions on the rental price of the listed properties.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, feature engine, xgboost, math, joblib, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Listing dataset contains the hosts information, the condition of listed properties, the reviews and more. 
* **Output:** Predicted rental price of the listed properties.

### Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.

**CLUSTERING -** This project focuses on bank credir risk in particular the customer credit which is the bank will gain from giving credit only if the customers will not default on the loan, which means that they will not repay the debt. One of the solutions to address the bank problem is to use hierarchical clustering, which requires creating clusters that have predetermined order from bottom to top using the Agglomerative which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm uses to cluster unlabeled data points.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, wordcloud, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Loaddefault dataset contains customers’ history, such as age, debt ratio, monthly income, number of open credit lines and loans and more.
* **Output:** Discovered a cluster of customers with high credit risk.

**ASSOCIATION RULES -** This project create recommendation systems that are being widely used in all forms of digital platforms; Association rules can be applied in the form of TV Shows recommendation systems to discover the existing relations between features in the database.  By analysing the database, which contains TV shows of distinguishable users, it can find some interesting rules occurring in analysed data.

* **Python libraries used:**  pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, mlxtend, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** TV Shows dataset contains 9690 record of TV show watched by different customers.
* **Output:** Recommended the next TV show that a customer will be interested in watching.

### Neural networks are loosely inspired by our brain. When your brain recognizes an object such as a horse saddle, a pattern of nerve cells will fire as a response to that stimulus. The visual of the horse itself will fire a different pattern of cells. So too do deep neural networks give certain responses depending on the input we feed them. But unlike humans, the neurons of a deep neural network are mathematical functions that receive input as numbers. The neurons take these numbers and perform calculations. If the calculation is able to reach a certain threshold (called a weight), the input is then passed on to a second set of neurons for more calculations and so on in a cascading effect. But machines also have a tool called “back propagation” that isn’t present in biology. Through back propagation information can go backwards through the network if the system is ever incorrect, helping it to better learn by sending data from the output layer back to the hidden layers for refinement.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a class of deep neural networks most commonly used for analysing visual imagery. Convolution layers are the building blocks of CNNs. Convolution is the simple application of a filter to an input that results in activation. Repeated application of the same filter to an input results in a map of activations called a feature map, indicating the locations and strength of a detected feature in input, such as an image. What makes CNN so powerful and useful is that it can generate excellent predictions with minimal image preprocessing. Also, the CNN is immune to spatial variance and can detect features anywhere in the input images.

**IMAGE CLASSIFICATIONS -** This project focuses on to build various multiclass image classification models to recognise and classify ten different types of food.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, scipy, wordcloud, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib.
* **Input:** Images of baby back ribs, bibimbap, cupcakes, dumplings, fried calamari, garlic bread, lasagna, pancakes, prime rib, and tiramisu.
* **Output:** Accurately classified the ten different types of food correctly.

### The process of finding trends and correlations in our data by representing it pictorially is called Data Visualization. To perform data visualization in python, we can use various python data visualization modules such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, etc. In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.

**DATA VISUALIZATION -** This project focuses on by assuming that you are part of the market research team for Cardio Good Fitness, a retail business specializing in the sales of treadmills. The team has collected data on individuals who purchased a treadmill at the Cardio Good Fitness retail stores for the past three months.
Through data preparation, exploration and visualisation, the market research team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product lines with respect to customer characteristics.

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, scipy, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, bokeh.
* **Input:** cardio dataset contains products, branches, genders, ages, educations of customers, model of treadmills and more.
* **Output:** Discovered vast differences across various product lines with respect to customer characteristics.
